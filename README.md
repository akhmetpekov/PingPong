# PingPong
Ping Pong is a classic computer game in which the player controls a paddle to hit a small dot or square across the screen, simulating a game of table tennis. The player must use the paddle to keep the dot or square within the boundaries of the screen and hit it back and forth, trying to score points by making the dot or square hit the opponent's side of the screen without them being able to hit it back.
